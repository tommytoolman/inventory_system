# Project TODO ‚Äì Inventory Management System
*Last updated: 2025-03-09*

> We only tick or strike items once we have confirmed they are done in production.

## üî¥ High Priority (Production blockers)
- [ ] **Sold item email alerts** ‚Äì send notification emails to 2-3 configured recipients whenever a product transitions into a sold state.
- [ ] **Reverb new listing flow fails** ‚Äì diagnose current API/CSV path so new products publish end-to-end without manual intervention.
- [ ] **eBay shipping profiles out of sync** ‚Äì align listing UI and background sync with the correct Business Policy IDs (Adam to supply new profiles) and expose configuration instead of hardcoding.
- [ ] **eBay condition/category parsing** ‚Äì fix the `'list' object has no attribute "get"` error, consolidate service modules, and flesh out the remaining condition/category mappings.
- [ ] **Inventorised items workflow broken** ‚Äì verify the new propagation with a full sale test (sync event should recognise stocked items and fan out quantity changes).
- [ ] **VR removal logic** ‚Äì treat VR ‚Äúnot found on API‚Äù sync events as `REMOVED` (not sold) unless Reverb also signals an end; surface ‚ÄúList Item‚Äù on detail pages while keeping VR sales events authoritative.

## üü° Medium Priority (Stability and automation)
- [ ] **Category mapping migration** ‚Äì move the JSON mappings into a database table with Alembic migrations and seeding.
- [ ] **Reinstate Shopify SEO keyword generator button** ‚Äì revert the auto-fill experiment and restore the manual generate flow (with richer keyword logic) once requirements are clarified.
- [ ] **Platform error handling standardisation** ‚Äì unify logging/alerts and ensure retries work the same across eBay, Reverb, VR, and Shopify.
- [ ] **"Where sold" logic improvements** ‚Äì refine attribution so reporting shows the definitive sale source for each SKU (tie into sold notifications and sale channel attribution).
- [ ] **Async listing publication flow** ‚Äì move manual listing actions (especially VR create/update) into the same background queue model so operators aren‚Äôt blocked during long Selenium/HTTP cycles.
- [ ] **Reverb YouTube embed parity** ‚Äì ensure listing creation/edit stores the video URL in both the dedicated field and description so embeds render.
- [ ] **Title/description sync coverage** ‚Äì confirm the new edit propagation pushes title/description updates to Shopify, eBay, Reverb, and VR end-to-end.
- [ ] **Reverb item creation pricing drift** ‚Äì update the default Reverb price recommendation to reflect the new fee structure while keeping manual overrides available.
- [ ] **Dropbox media refresh is inconsistent** ‚Äì stabilise cache refresh, keep folder tiles a consistent size, and reduce redundant re-renders after multiple reloads.
- [ ] **Fully automate sync pipeline** ‚Äì move from operator-triggered runs to scheduled execution; confirm cronjob/worker (including Dropbox refresh) is running and instrument failure alerts.
- [x] **Offload platform sync workloads** ‚Äì move long-running sync jobs (especially Vintage & Rare) into background workers/threads so the FastAPI app stays responsive during imports and item creation.
- [ ] **Product sold flag parity** ‚Äì ensure `products.is_sold` flips appropriately when listings are ended versus genuine sale events so reporting stays accurate.
- [ ] **Sync-all queue follow-up** ‚Äì reconcile the queued `/api/sync/all` background orchestrator with the current batched implementation (status polling, history retention, websocket notifications) so the endpoint remains non-blocking without regressing the latest changes.
- [ ] **Platform stats ingestion gaps** ‚Äì fill in watches/likes/views for eBay, Shopify, VR, matching the partial Reverb feed and surface them on dashboards.
- [ ] **Field coverage audit** ‚Äì verify every sync run populates mandatory listing fields (shipping, condition, attributes, compliance text) across platforms.
- [ ] **eBay listing backfill script** ‚Äì write a job that refreshes ebay_listings rows from master product data, preserves/detects CrazyLister payloads, and keeps descriptions in sync (e.g., item 257112518866).
- [ ] **Activity report tidy-up** ‚Äì debug the report pipeline and trim noisy or duplicate rows so it is usable for daily review.
- [ ] **Recent activity & sales report fixes** ‚Äì address the minor bugs observed in the activity feeds and sales summaries.
- [ ] **VR listing ID capture from instruments/show** ‚Äì after Selenium submits a listing, scrape the authenticated `/instruments/show` page to grab the new product ID before falling back to the CSV export.
- [x] **Price sync on edits** ‚Äì re-run outbound pricing syncs whenever an operator updates a product‚Äôs pricing fields.

## üîµ Low Priority (Enhancements)
- [ ] **VR reconciliation improvements** ‚Äì capture listing IDs reliably (current process is brittle), compare download inventory against `vr_listings`, share creation helpers, and add retry logic.
- [ ] **Testing & verification rebuild** ‚Äì restore integration coverage for sync flows, add regression tests for the high-risk services, and document the verification checklist.
- [ ] **Populate Shopify archive gallery** ‚Äì build the historical gallery view using the archive dataset so users can review past listings.
- [ ] **CrazyLister integration discovery** ‚Äì investigate feasibility, fix description stripping on edits, and decide whether to proceed.
- [ ] **Sold date surfaces** ‚Äì expose the confirmed sold timestamp on product detail pages and reports when available.
- [ ] **Additional user access** ‚Äì review authentication/authorization stack to add more user accounts with appropriate roles.
- [ ] **NPI clustering report** ‚Äì add a New Product Introduction cluster view grouped by category for merch planning.
- [ ] **Document CLI sync utilities** ‚Äì in addition to API routes, catalogue every `scripts/` entry point (imports, event processors, VR helpers) that touches the sync flow so the docs cover both web and command-line usage.
- [ ] **Platform data JSON audit** ‚Äì standardise how `platform_common.platform_specific_data` is populated across services and document which fields should graduate to structured columns.

## üü£ Backlog (Track, revisit as time allows)
- **Database notes:** Products need `price` mirroring `base_price`, `quantity` defaulting to 1 when not stocked, and image URLs rewritten to Reverb CDN paths after sync runs.
- **Database notes:** Platform common rows should normalise Shopify status casing, flip VR syncs from `pending` after the ID-resolution hop, save the canonical Shopify listing URL, and refresh `platform_specific_data` contents.
- **Database notes:** Vintage & Rare listings stay `pending` despite the follow-up fetch; plan for persisting creation snapshots separately from later sync updates (possibly via a new JSON column).
- **Database notes:** Reverb listings miss `reverb_slug` and `condition_rating`; the latest `extended_attributes` should be compared with older rows to ensure we still capture the full payload (price guide, shipping profile, etc.).
- **Database notes:** Pricing validation should compare against each platform's stored price (e.g., VR price) rather than `products.base_price`, so intentional per-platform deltas stop raising mismatches.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] **Shopify archive build-out** ‚Äì populate the archive dataset and surface "archived" status in the dashboard for Shopify listings.
- [x] **Inventory edit sync wiring** ‚Äì connect the edit form‚Äôs platform checkboxes to real sync calls so saving a product can push updates immediately.
- [x] **VR inventorised sales handling** ‚Äì ensure VR sale events decrement inventory, fan out quantity changes, and keep VR listings active until stock hits zero.
- [x] **Editor description rendering mismatch** ‚Äì ensure the product edit view loads descriptions into the TinyMCE editor instead of raw HTML.
- [x] **Shopify archived count** ‚Äì display the count of archived Shopify SKUs on the dashboard overview card.
- [x] **Shopify pricing parity** ‚Äì apply a 5% discount when cloning Reverb listings, rounding up to the nearest ¬£x,999 across all Shopify creation paths.
- [x] **eBay CrazyLister detection** ‚Äì flag eBay listings that use the CrazyLister template via HTML markers so we can prioritise refreshes.
- [x] **Draft media persistence** ‚Äì store draft uploads in shared storage per draft and clean up orphaned files after edits so drafts survive machine or redeploy changes.
- [x] **Image draft persistence** ‚Äì ensure draft uploads are stored on Railway (or other web-accessible storage) so templates and Reverb creation always have public URLs.
- [x] **Product grid layout tweak** ‚Äì cap category column width on the Products table so ‚ÄúView‚Äù/status controls remain visible without horizontal scrolling.
- [x] **EU data hard-code review** ‚Äì remove any remaining hard-coded EU shipping/tax details and move to configuration or platform data.
