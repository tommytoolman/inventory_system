🚀 WHICH KILLER REPORT SHOULD WE BUILD NEXT?
Based on your amazing data setup, here are my top recommendations:

🔥 OPTION 1: "Price Performance Analysis"
Show which items are priced optimally vs. those that need adjustment

High engagement, no sales = Price too high
Immediate sales = Price too low
Sweet spot identification = Perfect pricing
Platform price comparison = Arbitrage opportunities
💰 OPTION 2: "Platform Arbitrage Finder"
Find items performing differently across platforms

Same item selling on Reverb but not eBay = Opportunity
Price differences across platforms
Platform-specific performance patterns
Revenue reallocation recommendations
⚡ OPTION 3: "Inventory Velocity Dashboard"
Speed of sales analysis

Fast movers (< 30 days)
Medium movers (30-90 days)
Slow movers (90+ days)
Category velocity comparison
Seasonal trends
🎯 OPTION 4: "Dead Stock Liquidation Planner"
Advanced version of NPI with action plans

Progressive price reduction recommendations
Bundle opportunities (group slow items)
Liquidation timeline optimization
Cost of capital calculations
❓ WHICH ONE EXCITES YOU MOST?
My vote is for the "Price Performance Analysis" - it'll give immediate revenue impact and uses all your rich engagement data (views, watches, offers) to make pricing recommendations!
