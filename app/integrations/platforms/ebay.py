"""
Defines the EbayPlatform class, correctly inheriting from PlatformInterface.
Status: The required methods (update_stock, get_current_stock, sync_status) are present but are currently stubs. 
They contain comments indicating where eBay API logic should go but lack the actual implementation 
(e.g., using an eBay SDK or HTTP client like httpx/requests to call the relevant eBay Inventory API endpoints).
Observation: The structure is correct, providing the necessary integration point for the StockManager. 
However, the core functionality of interacting with the eBay API needs to be implemented within these methods.
