      "description": "<p><strong>THE BIRTH OF THE CLASH</strong></p>\n<p>We are happy to offer the following instrument from one of the most respected guitarists of the Post Punk Movement that being the late Keith Levene, founding member of the Clash. Hailed as an innovative guitarist who helped shape the sound of punk, Levene cowrote the song &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Name&rdquo; from The Clash&rsquo;s 1977 debut album. Please see details as follows</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>Please see link for full history and credits of Artist</p>\n<p>Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Terry Chimes, Paul Simenon and Keith Levine became The Clash in late 1976. Inspired by seeing The Sex Pistols and the music they were making, the boys quickly evolved a stance and image that endeared them to the punk masses. Their first outing was a gig at their rehearsal studios in Camden for journalists and friends which caused Giovanni Dadomo a reviewer for Sounds to opine 'I think they're the first band to come along who'll really frighten the Sex Pistols shitless.' Indeed their first public gig was supporting The Sex Pistols at The Screen On The Green Islington London. Charles Shaar Murray, in a famous quote he wishes he'd never made, said in the NME they '..are the kind of garage band who should speedily be returned to their garage, preferably with the motor running.'

      "description": "<p>CLASSIC BOUTIQUE</p>\n<p>We are pleased to offer the following classic boutique amplifier</p>\n<p>The 45W Roseland is a purist design, all tube 1&times;12 combo with reverb and tremolo powered by a pair of 6L6 tubes. Its&rsquo; single channel Multi Voice preamp offers an incredibly wide range of voicings ranging from sparkly cleans to thick, woody tweed to driven plexi crunch and grind. It includes tube driven spring reverb with both mix and dwell controls to fine tune the reverb sound to be as splashy or subtle as you choose. Its bias modulation tremolo has a particularly smooth and round effect. The solid wood cabinet with unified baffle/body construction delivers a lively, deeply resonant, and unconstricted sound.

The BPC MKI features the same transistor specification as the original so includes 1x OC75 + 2x 2G381 this configuaration has a unique tone which cannot be replicated by the often offered 3xOC75 version. It was this version which found its way into the hands of artists such as Jeff Beck, Pete Townsend and Mick Ronson and can be heard on many classic tracks such as &lsquo;Hang onto yourself&rsquo; and &lsquo;Moonage Daydream&rsquo;.\n</span>\n<strong>MKI.5 Tone Bender Spec:</strong>\n<span>Often known as the mythical fuzz due to the very few original examples which exist, the MKI.5 Tone Bender was produced in 1966 and was the first tone bender that featured the iconic Grey Hammerite Aluminium Casing. The MKI.5 featured a different circuit than the earlier production MK I and consisted of a 2x OC75 transistor circuit At the time of production one of these rare fuzzes managed to find its way into Abbey Road Studios and was pictured being used by George Harrison of The Beatles.\n</span>\n<strong>Professional MKII Tone Bender Spec:</strong>\n<span><span>The BPC MKII Tone Bender OC81D is a detailed replica of the 1966 PROFESSIONAL MK II Tone Bender pedals created by Gary Hurst. The circuit unlike the MK 1.5 had a 3 Transistor circuit which, based on production/supply comprised of either OC75&rsquo;s or OC81D transistors. This OC81D Loaded MK II can be heard on many Jimmy/Led Zeppelin Tracks such as &lsquo;Whole lotta love&rsquo;. This was the pedal seen being used by Jimmy on the recent &lsquo;It Might get loud &lsquo; documentary.\n\n<strong>BuzzaroundSpec:\n</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>This is a detailed replica of the original 1965 Burns Buzzaround pedal that to many is the HOLY GRAIL OF EFFECTS.The Buzzaround is a unique fuzz which utilised 3 x NKT213 transistors and for the first time offered a timbre control which gives different dimension to your fuzz tone. The Buzzaround also came in a unique wedge shaped casing with controls on the front. This added to the pedals uniqueness. and was most famously used by Robert Fripp.</p>\n<p><span><strong>BPC Pepbox Spec:</strong>\nBPC PEPBOX is a detailed replica of the original unit designed by Pepe Rush for WEM around 1965. This pedal was most famously used by John Lennon at Abbey Road studios during the Revolver Session and can be seen on many photographs from the period. The pedal features 2 Germanium ACY41 Transistors as per the original unit and is housed in a metal enclosure with engraved logo and control panels. The front panel features effect which acts as the gain and then a Level control for the overall volume.\n\n<strong>Notes:</strong>This is theultimate package for any fuzz freak or recording musician, adding the true sounds of the 60s to your recordingrepertoire.\n\nWith our Black Friday deal this is available for a limited period with 40% off RRP\n\nWHILE STOCKS LAST!\n\n</span></p>",

The Wandre Bikini was released in 1961 and it was concieved after Wandre was inspired by seeing Brigitte Bardot in the film et dieu crea la femme (And God Created a Woman).\n\nBardot wore a 2 piece bikini hence the instrument was in developed in two sections and the shape of the body and amplifier came from his passion for motorcycles. Please see specifications as follows</p>\n<h2>1961 Wandre Bikini</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Guitar 2 Pickup</li>\n<li>Transistor Amplifier (This was also the First Ever Produced Transistor Guitar Amplifier)</li>\n<li>Internally - Externally Original</li>\n<li>Condition 9/10 (Exceptional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notes -</strong>\nThe above instrument based on the bizarre, rarity, unique factor is highly desired and is one of the most desired wandre models</p>\n<p></p>",

      "description": "<p>Leslie West first gained recognition as the lead guitarist for the Vagrants, a locally popular 1960s Long Island group. One of that band's singles was produced by Felix Pappalardi, a bass player who also produced Cream. After the Vagrants and Cream split up, Pappalardi played bass on and produced West's debut solo album, Mountain (July 1969). Following its release, the two teamed up with drummer Norman Smart (soon replaced by Corky Laing) and keyboard player Steve Knight to form the Hard Rock band Mountain.</p>\n<p><strong>LESLIE WEST MPC ELECTRA PROTOTYPE</strong></p>\n<p>1970s \nTwin Humbuckers \nTremolo \nTranslucent Black Finish</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>The above instrument was Leslie's main Instrument from circa 1980 - 1986 and can be seen being used in both live and touring performances</p>\n<p><strong>Verification</strong></p>\n<p>The instrument comes with</p>\n<p>Personal Hand Signed COA</p>\n<p>Various Archival Photographs of use</p>",

In the early 1970s he recorded a couple of singles with a band called SPX, with Alan Diaz, Charlie Mercado and Frank Lopez. He joined Twisted Sister in 1975. In 1989 he started the band Scarecrow.He also recorded a solo album named Axes To Axes in 2005 featuring Dee Snider, Ronnie James Dio and Rudy Sarzo among others. In a 2006 interview with rock &amp; roll comic C.C. Banana, Eddie revealed if Twisted Sister ever retired that it would still be possible for the band to continue performing under their alternate name Bent Brother. Eddie, along with other popular rock guitarists in the mid-80's, performed in the Hear 'n Aid project, launched by Ronnie James Dio, which had a similar goal as both Band Aid and USA for Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>Eddie Ojeda's Guild Aviator</strong>\n\n1980s\nSet Neck\nEbony Fingerboard\nTwin Humbuckers\nLocking Tremolo\nBlack Hardware\nPart of Eddie Ojeda's personal collection\n\nCOA - Instrument comes full detailed and signed verification to confirm use / ownership</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>We are happy to offer the following instrument that was personally owned and used by one of the world's most legendary guitars that being Eric Clapton, details as follows</strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE ERIC CLAPTON FIREBIRD I</strong></p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>In April 1968, during Cream's U.S. tour, Eric Clapton acquired a 1964 Gibson Firebird I, likely on April 13th in Philadelphia. This purchase is documented in Cream's tour ledger, which lists a 'musical equipment' expense of $905.50 on that date. The Firebird I featured a distinctive reverse body design and a single mini-humbucker pickup, offering a unique tone that set it apart from Clapton&rsquo;s previous guitars. Before adopting the Firebird, Clapton was most famously associated with his Gibson SG, known as 'The Fool,' which was painted in a psychedelic design. The Firebird I represented a shift in both sound and style, providing a cutting, powerful tone that complemented Cream&rsquo;s heavier blues-rock direction.</p>\n<p>Clapton used the Firebird I extensively during Cream's final U.S. tour in 1968, as well as on their farewell performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The guitar was also played during the brief existence of Blind Faith, where Clapton experimented with a different musical approach. The Firebird&rsquo;s raw tone and sustain made it a standout instrument for live performances, and it became a key part of Clapton&rsquo;s signature sound in this period. Unlike the Gibson SG, which had a more rounded and warm tone, the Firebird I delivered a sharper attack, which suited Cream&rsquo;s powerful improvisations on stage.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the guitar, Clapton later said,<em><strong>'I remember one night in particular with the Firebird. It was a Cream show in Philadelphia, and it was one of the greatest gigs I ever played.'</strong></em>His admiration for the Firebird I was evident in the way he integrated it into his performances, making it one of the defining instruments of his late-&rsquo;60s era. The guitar's unique look and powerful sound contributed to some of the most memorable performances of his career, and it remains an iconic part of Clapton's history.</p>\n<p><strong>Gibson Firebird I</strong></p>\n<p>Artist Proof Number &ldquo;4&rdquo;</p>\n<p>2000s Production</p>\n<p>1964 Specification</p>\n<p>Sunburst Cellulose Finish</p>\n<p>Single Pickup</p>\n<p>Nickel Hardware</p>\n<p>Case ( Pre Production , Prototype Style FB Case )</p>\n<p>EC FB &ldquo; 4 &ldquo; Labelled</p>\n<p>Added / Spare Compensator Bridge</p>\n<p>Condition - Played , Used</p>\n<p><strong>Production</strong></p>\n<p>The above instrument was one of six Artist Proof Prototype Firebirds that were produced by the Gibson Artist Division and given to Eric Clapton for test inspection and playing purposes</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>Artist Proof &ldquo; Number 4 &ldquo; was personally gifted By Eric Clapton to fellow guitarist Alan Darby during the Crossroads Guitar Festival, picture attached</p>\n<p><strong>Verification</strong></p>\n<p>The instrument comes with a personalised letter from Alan Darby's guitar technician confirming said history.</p>\n<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>\n<p>The above instrument is highly documented owned and used Gibson FB I from the world's most legendary guitarist that being Eric Clapton.</p>\n<p><strong>ALL EU PURCHASES ARE DELIVERED WITH TAXES AND DUTIES PAID</strong></p>\n<p>All purchases include EU Taxes / Duties paid , ie nothing further is due on receipt of goods to any EU State.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY BUY FROM US</strong></p>\n<p>We are one of the world's leading specialists in used and vintage gear with over 30 years of experience.

      "description": "<p><strong><span style='font-size: medium;'>History</span></strong></p>\n<p>Wolfgang Palm is a German musician and inventor who was the founder and owner of Palm Products GmbH (PPG) and the inventor and creator of various pioneering technical designs for analog and digital synthesizers. He is widely acknowledged as the father of digital synthesis and as a trendsetter in the use of computer technology in the making of electronic music.</p>\n<p>Palm's interest in synthesis technology began as a keyboardist in various local bands in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany. His namesake corporation began operating as early as 1975, manufacturing modular synthesizers in small numbers for electronica act Tangerine Dream and other musicians.</p>\n<p>Palm is arguably most famous for the invention of wavetable synthesis, a concept which he developed in the late 1970s when he created his Minimoog-like synthesizer - the 1020 - featuring digitally controlled oscillators instead of the voltage-controlled oscillators that his 1002 synthesizer and all other analog synthesizers of that time were using. He also created the 360 Wavecomputer that would later become the renowned PPG Wave series. Palm's design was the impetus for the creation of the highly successful PPG Wave synthesizer, which was used by numerous bands throughout the 1980s and beyond.</p>\n<p><span style='font-size: medium;'><strong>THE PPG MODULAR SYSTEM</strong></span></p>\n<p>100, 200, and 300 Modules\n2 Cabinets 1 Keyboard\nEach Module Hand Labelled by Wolfgang Palm</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cabinet one consists of :</strong></p>\n<p>3x 301 Voltage Controlled Oscillator\n2x 104 Low Pass Filter\n1x Oscillator with 3 Oscillators and Oscillator Driver\n1x Wolfgang Palm Noise Generator\n1x 217 Voltage Controlled Filter\n3x 103 VCA\n1x 309 Signal Mixer\n4 x 109 Premix Interface\n1x 111 CV interface/Reverb/Output Bass Treble/Power Supply</p>\n<p><strong>Cabinet Two Consists of:</strong></p>\n<p>3x107 Envelope Generator\n3x 307 Dual Envelope Generator\n1x 213 Step Sequencer\n322 Duophonic Digital Keyboard</p>\n<p>Notes: The keyboard comes with all the original German Manuals 230V Power supply and various patching cables</p>\n<p>Users: PPG Synthesisers have been favored by a number of artists most famously the German Band Tangerine Dream / Klaus Schulze with such classic albums as Rubycon, Stratofear, Sorcerers \n\n</p>",

On an upcoming trip to New York, Clive requested that Barrie purchase a short scale guitar that was similar to one John Lennon played. During his visit, Barrie met with a close personal friend, Mal Evans (John Lennon's PA / Beatles Technician) and discussed Clive's request.

At their core, the trio of Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard, and Dusty Hill were a down-and-dirty blues band from Houston, cranking out greasy rockers and slyly sleazy boogies about 'Tush,' a 'Pearl Necklace,' and 'Legs.' Despite their deep roots in American rock &amp; roll and blues, ZZ Top were the furthest thing from purists. During their hot streak -- which ran all the way from the mid-'70s through the mid-'80s &ndash;- there wasn't a fad they didn't exploit, twisting new wave, synthesized dance-rock, and music videos for their own purposes. Throughout it all, they wrapped all their hooks and riffs up in a smile disguised by bushy beards and flashy showmanship that not only earned the group a massive audience, but endured well into the 21st century, when they were surrounded by disciples and acolytes, proof that they were a beloved American musical institution.</p>\n<strong>Fender Dusty Hill Custom Prototype Precision Bass</strong>\n\n<span>Black</span>\n<span>50s P Bass Style</span>\n<span>Reverse Headstock</span>\n<span>Custom Shop Produced</span>\n<span>Hand Signed by Dusty Hill</span>\n\n<span>History - The above instrument is a Prototype produced within the Fender Custom Shop and can be seen in both live and video performances</span>\n\n<span>COA - Instrument comes full detailed and signed verification to confirm use / ownership</span>\n\n<span>Note - ZZ Top are one of he most recognised and distinct of all Rock N Roll bands and are renowned for there use of unique and distinct instruments</span></div>",

      "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>BPC MKI Wooden Case Prototype Tone Bender</strong></p>\n<p>The UK fuzz box phenomenon began in 1965 when electronics engineer Gary Stewart Hurst designed an effects pedal called a Tone Bender. The first production version of the Tone Bender is referred to as the Tone Bender MKI. The MKI featured a three transistor circuit that was based upon the Gibson built Maestro Fuzz-tone. This circuit was modified by Hurst to produce more sustain than its American counter part. The story goes that guitar legend Vic Flick, the man responsible for the James Bond Theme, brought a Fuzz-tone (FZ-1) to Hurst and requested the sustain to be increased. The Tone Bender was one the first ever British made Fuzz box available to the public and sold for 14 guineas. THE BIRTH OF BRITISH FUZZ WAS BORN!</p>\n<p><strong>Casing</strong></p>\n<p>The original &ldquo;PROTOTYPE&rdquo; units were housed in a primitive wooden box case and were distributed to session players on the London scene including Jeff Beck. Due to Beck&rsquo;s heavy use of the pedal he smashed the unit with his heavy foot stomping movements while playing on stage. As word got out about Gary Hurst new design he changed the construction material to steel in order to live up to the rigours of stage use. Comments If Fuzz is your thing then the above will be of interest from both players and collectors a like that creates both the look styling and tone of Britains most famous and iconic of all fuzz effects</p>\n<p><strong>BPC MKITone Bender</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1965 Prototype Reissue</li>\n<li>Hand Produced</li>\n<li>Wooden Wedge Shape Case</li>\n<li>Point to point Wiring (Non Circuit board)</li>\n<li>2x 2G381 + 1x OC75</li>\n<li>Correct Period Aluminium Knobs</li>\n<li>Top Input Jack</li>\n<li>Rear Output Jack</li>\n<li>Manual On/Off Switch</li>\n<li>Hand Stained Finish</li>\n<li>10 Models Produced worldwide</li>\n<li>Internally signed and Numbered by Builder ( 1 &ndash; 10 )</li>\n<li>Ltd Edition Certificate</li>\n</ul>",
