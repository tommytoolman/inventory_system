Once again, I had never played a Dan Armstrong &ndash; I just remembered seeing a lot of guys playing them in the &rsquo;70s &ndash; Mark Bolin, Joe Perry. It was the guitar that, as a young teenager, I saw in the shop and thought, &ldquo;I want that guitar!&rdquo; So, I finally bought one, and when I got it, I was struck by how it&rsquo;s very different from my Les Pauls, very different from my Teles. And strangely enough, it had a lot of gain; it has the pickup modules &ndash; Country Bass and Rock Treble. I use Rock Treble, and the guitar doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of sustain. But, its tone is nice. I was using the Voxes at the time and it sounded great playing those GnR riffs.'</em></em></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Comments</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This guitar was a key ingredient to the sound and look of Gilby Clarke on many live performances with Guns and Roses.

The first production version of the Tone Bender is referred to as the Tone Bender MKI. The MKI featured a three transistor circuit that was based upon the Gibson built Maestro Fuzz-tone. This circuit was modified by Hurst to produce more sustain than its American counter part. The story goes that guitar legend Vic Flick, the man responsible for the James Bond Theme, brought a Fuzz-tone (FZ-1) to Hurst and requested the sustain to be increased. The Tone Bender was one the first ever British made Fuzz box available to the public and sold for 14 guineas. THE BIRTH OF BRITISH FUZZ WAS BORN!</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Casing</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The original &ldquo;PROTOTYPE&rdquo; units were housed in a primitive wooden box case and were distributed to session players on the London scene including Jeff Beck. Due to Beck&rsquo;s heavy use of the pedal he smashed the unit with his heavy foot stomping movements while playing on stage. As word got out about Gary Hurst new design he changed the construction material to steel in order to live up to the rigours of stage use.

Hailed as an innovative guitarist who helped shape the sound of punk, Levene cowrote the song &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Name&rdquo; from The Clash&rsquo;s 1977 debut album. Please see details as follows</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>Please see link for full history and credits of Artist</p>\n<p>Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Terry Chimes, Paul Simenon and Keith Levine became The Clash in late 1976. Inspired by seeing The Sex Pistols and the music they were making, the boys quickly evolved a stance and image that endeared them to the punk masses. Their first outing was a gig at their rehearsal studios in Camden for journalists and friends which caused Giovanni Dadomo a reviewer for Sounds to opine 'I think they're the first band to come along who'll really frighten the Sex Pistols shitless.' Indeed their first public gig was supporting The Sex Pistols at The Screen On The Green Islington London. Charles Shaar Murray, in a famous quote he wishes he'd never made, said in the NME they '..are the kind of garage band who should speedily be returned to their garage, preferably with the motor running.' This was too much for Levine who left leaving the boys as a four piece.</p>\n<p><strong>Fernandes E series</strong></p>\n<p>1990s</p>\n<p>Grey Burst</p>\n<p>Flamed top</p>\n<p>Humbucker</p>\n<p>Hot Rail in Neck</p>\n<p>Fernandez Floyd Rose Style Tremolo</p>\n<p>Condition - Stage , Tour Used</p>\n<p>Signed verification confirming ownership and use by the artist</p>\n<p><strong>The Levene Style</strong></p>\n<p>According to John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Levene's style was &ldquo;spectacular , .explored the possibilities of what you can do with the guitar'.Upon his death, Massive Attack described Levene as an 'artist, architect and re-inventor of punk rock&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>\n<p>The above instrument will be to those players , collectors and investors whom have interest in an instrument that was personally owned and used by this highly respected Post Punk Guitarist and founding member of both the Clash and PiL.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>ALL EU PURCHASES ARE DELIVERED WITH TAXES AND DUTIES PAID</strong>\n\nAll purchases include EU Taxes / Duties paid , ie nothing further is due on receipt of goods to any EU State \n\n<strong>WHY BUY FROM US</strong>\n\nWe are one of the world's leading specialists in used and vintage gear with over 30 years of experience.

McKenzie had years of experience customizing and building cars and motorcycles and was inspired to make the Rockit electric guitar with a design based on a motorcycle gas tank. McKenzie's friends at the Gompf Brackets company lent their machine shop, tooling and CAD expertise to the project. Although the prototype was made from an actual gas tank the production Rockit guitar bodies were made of fibreglass (much lighter) and could be customised with hot-rod graphics, gold and silver inlays and diamond fret markers. They sold for around $5,000 to $7,000 each.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><strong>ALL EU PURCHASES ARE DELIVERED WITH TAXES AND DUTIES PAID</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All purchases include EU Taxes / Duties paid , ie nothing further is due on receipt of goods to any EU State.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>WHY BUY FROM US</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are one of the world's leading specialists in used and vintage gear with over 30 years of experience.

McKenzie had years of experience customizing and building cars and motorcycles and was inspired to make the Rockit electric guitar with a design based on a motorcycle gas tank. McKenzie's friends at the Gompf Brackets company lent their machine shop, tooling and CAD expertise to the project. Although the prototype was made from an actual gas tank the production Rockit guitar bodies were made of fibreglass (much lighter) and could be customised with hot-rod graphics, gold and silver inlays and diamond fret markers. They sold for around $5,000 to $7,000 each.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><strong>ALL EU PURCHASES ARE DELIVERED WITH TAXES AND DUTIES PAID</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All purchases include EU Taxes / Duties paid , ie nothing further is due on receipt of goods to any EU State.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>WHY BUY FROM US</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are one of the world's leading specialists in used and vintage gear with over 30 years of experience.

Upstairs it had lots of guitars and there was a glass case with a few select guitars in it and it had a guitar I&rsquo;d never seen in real life, a Gibson ES-150D. When you look at it straight on, it looks like a 335. It&rsquo;s walnut, it&rsquo;s got block mother-of-pearl markers and a master volume on the lower horn. When you look at it from the side, it&rsquo;s the depth of a 175. So it&rsquo;s like a 175 but in the shape of a 335.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Next thing I did was phone my guitar tech and said, &lsquo;If I buy a semi-acoustic, have we got room in the big flight case?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah&hellip;&rsquo; So I bought it. I took it to the soundcheck and Robert Fripp was very enamoured of it.'</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Verification</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The instrument comes with the following verification</p>\n<p>Personal COA from Michael 'Jakko' Jakszyk</p>\n<p>Various Archival Pictures of Use</p>\n<p><strong><strong>ALL EU PURCHASES ARE DELIVERED WITH TAXES AND DUTIES PAID</strong></strong>\n\n</p>\n<p>All purchases include EU Taxes / Duties paid, i.e., nothing further is due on receipt of goods to any EU State.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>WHY BUY FROM US</strong></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are one of the world's leading specialists in used and vintage gear with over 30 years of experience.

Choose the Halo Inductor to add richness and punch to your lead tones.\n\n</p>\n<p>BRIGHT CLARITY &amp; LUSH HARMONICS: THE RED FASEL&reg; INDUCTOR.</p>\n<p>The sound of the Cry Baby Wah's modern era, the red Fasel inductor serves up bright clarity and lush harmonics. Combined with the circuitry of the GCB95, this inductor allows you to kick it on at super high volumes without any unwanted squeal. When it's time for high gain and big, crunchy chords, go with the red Fasel Inductor.\n\n</p>\n<p>TOGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO WITH THE KICK OF A SWITCH.</p>\n<p>Go back and forth between the Halo and Fasel Inductors at any time with the kickswitch conveniently located on the right side of the pedal.\n\n</p>\n<p>FINE-TUNED FOR YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE.</p>\n<p>Shape the sound of each inductor to meet the needs of just about any situation. Each has its own toe-down frequency control, so you can balance them out or emphasize their natural qualities. If you want the red Fasel Inductor's clarity with smoother highs, dial back the toe-down frequency. For a super aggressive sound that cuts right through the mix, crank it up.
