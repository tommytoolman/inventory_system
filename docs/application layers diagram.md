Explanation:

Arrows (^/v) show the typical flow of control or data dependencies.
app/core/ components (config, enums, exceptions, utils) are shown separately as they provide foundational capabilities used by potentially all other layers (indicated by the arrows pointing towards the main stack). For instance, services use config for API keys, routes might use enums, services use models, routes use schemas, etc.

101

The Foundation: Data Layer (Database + Models)

What it is: This is where your application's data permanently resides. It's the ultimate source of truth.
In RIFFS: This is your PostgreSQL database and the SQLAlchemy models (app/models/). The models define the structure of your data (tables, columns, relationships) in Python code, which SQLAlchemy maps to the database schema.
Our Review: We started here (in the previous chat) because everything else depends on having a solid, well-defined data structure.


Interacting with Data: Data Access / ORM

What it is: Code that handles the mechanics of reading from and writing to the database.
In RIFFS: SQLAlchemy acts as your Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). It translates Python operations on your model objects (like creating a Product instance and saving it) into SQL commands for the PostgreSQL database, and vice-versa. Code within your app/services/ will use SQLAlchemy sessions and models to perform these database interactions.
Our Review: We refined the models (app/models/) which are the core part of this layer defined by the developer.


Defining Data Contracts: Schemas / Validation Layer

What it is: Defines the expected structure of data coming into and going out of your application, particularly at API boundaries. It ensures data conforms to expectations before being processed or sent back to a client.
In RIFFS: This is the role of your Pydantic schemas (app/schemas/). FastAPI uses these schemas extensively to automatically validate incoming request data (e.g., JSON payloads) and serialize outgoing response data. They act as a clear contract between your API and its consumers (and between different internal layers). You also have utility functions (model_to_schema) to convert between SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic schemas.
Our Review: This is our next planned step. We'll check if the schemas correctly represent the data needed for API operations and if they align well with the underlying models.


The Brains: Business Logic / Service Layer

What it is: This layer contains the core logic and rules of your application. It orchestrates operations, processes data, makes decisions, and interacts with the data layer (via models/ORM) and potentially external services (like the eBay/Reverb APIs).
In RIFFS: This is primarily your app/services/ directory. Files like product_service.py, ebay_service.py, reverb_service.py, stock_manager.py (in app/integrations/) would contain the logic for managing products, handling platform-specific interactions, synchronizing stock, etc. Services use models for data access and schemas for defining inputs/outputs or interacting with other layers/APIs.
Our Review: This will follow the schema review. We'll dive into how the application actually works.


The Interface: API / Presentation Layer

What it is: This is the outermost layer that external clients (like a web browser, a mobile app, or even another service) interact with. It defines the API endpoints, handles incoming requests, and sends back responses.
In RIFFS: This is implemented using FastAPI in your app/routes/ directory. These files define the API paths (e.g., /products, /inventory/sync), handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), receive requests, call the appropriate service layer functions to perform actions, and use Pydantic schemas to format the responses.
Our Review: We'll look at this layer after the services to see how the application's functionality is exposed.


Supporting Components: Core / Configuration

What it is: These provide essential utilities, shared definitions, and configuration used across multiple layers.
In RIFFS: This is your app/core/ directory, containing config.py (settings), enums.py (shared constants), exceptions.py (custom errors), and utils.py (helper functions).
Our Review: We just reviewed this layer. Configuration is crucial as it influences how all other layers behave (e.g., which database to connect to, API keys for services).
Why "Moving Up"?

We started at the bottom (database/models) â€“ the foundation. We then checked configuration (core), which affects everything. Now, we're planning to move up layer by layer:

app/schemas: How data should look at the boundaries.
app/services: The core logic using models and schemas.
app/routes: How the logic is exposed via the API.
This flow mirrors how a request often travels: In through Routes -> Processed by Services (using Schemas for input validation) -> Interacts with Models/Database -> Returns data via Services (using Schemas for output) -> Out through Routes. Reviewing in this order helps build understanding logically.


Now that we have the data structures (Models) and data contracts (Schemas) refined, the next logical step is the Service Layer.

What it is: The Service Layer is the "engine" or the "brains" of your application. It sits between the API/Presentation Layer (app/routes/) and the Data Layer (app/models/).
Purpose: Its primary purpose is to encapsulate the application's business logic. This means it handles the "how" of doing things, separate from the "what" (data definition in models) and the "where" (API endpoints in routes).
Key Responsibilities:
Orchestration: Coordinating sequences of actions (e.g., when a product is sold: update status in DB, notify platforms, potentially trigger shipping logic).
Data Interaction: Using the SQLAlchemy models and database session (db: AsyncSession) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data.
Business Rules: Enforcing rules specific to your domain (e.g., ensuring a SKU is unique, calculating prices based on certain conditions, checking if a product can be listed on a specific platform).
External API Calls: Interacting with third-party APIs (like eBay, Reverb, DHL) using appropriate clients or HTTP libraries. This includes authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.
Data Transformation: Converting data between formats if necessary (e.g., mapping data from your Product model to the specific format required by the Reverb API, often using Pydantic schemas/DTOs).
Using Core Components: Leveraging configuration (app/core/config), utilities (app/core/utils), and custom exceptions (app/core/exceptions).
