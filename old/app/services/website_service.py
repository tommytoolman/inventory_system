"""
Purpose: Intended to handle interactions with your custom website platform. But may be changed to shopify_service.py if we go with Shopify.

Functionality: Currently only contains a stub publish_product method.

Role: Placeholder for website-specific service logic. Requires implementation (likely involving an HTTP client to call the website's API).
