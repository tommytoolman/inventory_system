Empty Files: parser.py and scraper.py are empty.

form_analysis.json: This JSON file meticulously lists input fields, select options, and buttons from web forms, likely on the Vintage & Rare website. This is typical preparatory work for web scraping â€“ understanding the structure of the forms you need to interact with automatically.

Untitled.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook shows an attempt to test V&R interaction logic (specifically inspect_form.login_and_navigate), which seems to involve making HTTP requests. The execution was interrupted. It suggests experimentation with automating V&R actions.

V&R_inv_test.ipynb: This notebook successfully uses VRInventoryManager (imported from app.services.vintageandrare.download_inventory) to authenticate and download the V&R inventory into a Pandas DataFrame. This confirms that the logic for reading inventory data from V&R via scraping is functional.

Missing Implementation: Crucially, there is no VRPlatform(PlatformInterface) class defined in this subdirectory or elsewhere in the provided files.
