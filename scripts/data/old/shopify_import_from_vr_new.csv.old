<p>The Idle Race were a British rock group from Birmingham who in the late 1960s and early 1970s had a cult following and in addition to being the springboard for Jeff Lynne, the band holds a place of significance in British Midlands' pop-rock history as a link between the Move, Electric Light Orchestra, the Steve Gibbons Band and Mike Sheridan &amp; The Nightriders.</p>

marshall-jtm45-head-silver-and-maroon-block-logo-uber-rare-1156150,1964 Marshall JTM45 Head Silver and Maroon Block Logo UBER RARE,"<p><strong>THE MARSHALL JTM-45</strong></p>
<p>The following is one of the rarest and most desired of all Marshall amplifiers, featuring the exceptionally rare Silver and Maroon Block Logo and early RS Transformers, details are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Marshall JTM45</strong></p>
<p>1964</p>
<p>Silver And Maroon Block Logo</p>
<p>Smooth Black Tolex</p>
<p>White Panel</p>
<p>Aluminium Rear</p>
<p>RS Mains &amp; Output Transformers</p>
<p>Internally/Externally Original (Normal service requirements)</p>
<p>Condition 9/10 (Light, Minimal Wear)</p>
<p><strong>History Of Production</strong></p>
<p>The Silver and Maroon Block Logo amplifiers were produced in exceptionally small numbers in 1964 / 1965 as a transitional amplifier between the Marshall Metal Badged ( Coffin ) JTM45 and the Later Gold Block logo 45s and, in collectors terms, is the rarest of all model variants.</p>
<p><strong>Sound / Tone -</strong>Based on High-Grade Component quality, values and circuit design, these early Marshall 45s have somewhat similar tonal characteristics to that of a Fender tweed amplifier, although with more gain/drive that is synonymous to that Classic Marshall Brit Tone and in collectors/players terms is the Ultimate JTM45.</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The above is the Optimum in Tone, Sound and Rarity</p>

marshall-gold-block-logo-jtm45-1161050,1965 Marshall Gold Block Logo JTM45,"<p><strong>THE BEST OF BRITISH TONE</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The following is one of the rarest and most desired of all Marshall amplifiers, featuring the rare Gold Block Logo, smooth pebble Levant, and early RS Transformers.</p>
<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>The amplifier was purchased from its second owner, who was gifted it by the original owner in 1970 and has remained in the same ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall JTM45</strong></p>
<p>1965</p>
<p>Gold Block Logo</p>
<p>Smooth Black Tolex</p>
<p>Gold Plexi Front</p>
<p>White Rear</p>
<p>Silver Disc Controls</p>
<p>RS Mains &amp; Output Transformers</p>
<p>Internally/Externally Original (All components original, untouched)</p>
<p>Condition 8.75/10 (Light, normal wear)</p>
<p><strong>HISTORY OF PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The first series Gold Block Logo JTM45s were produced in exceptionally small numbers and are highly sought after by both players and collectors due to their rarity and exceptional tonal qualities.</p>
<p><strong>SOUND/TONE</strong></p>
<p>Due to their high-grade component quality, values, and circuit design, these early Marshall 45s have tonal characteristics similar to a Fender Tweed amplifier but with more gain/drive, synonymous with classic Marshall British tone. In collector/player terms, this is the ultimate JTM45.</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>One of the world&rsquo;s most desired vintage amplifiers, both in tone and rarity. Favored by many iconic British artists, including Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend.</p>
