Okay, thank you for providing the test files. Let's review them to understand your testing approach and maintain consistency before we design the V&R tests.

Review of Existing Test Files:

1. conftest.py

Purpose: Sets up shared fixtures for pytest.
Test Database:
Defines a TEST_DATABASE_URL (good practice to separate test DB).
Creates a session-scoped test_engine using create_async_engine.
Crucially: It drop_all and create_all tables once per session using engine.begin(). This ensures a clean database for each test session (i.e., each run of pytest), but not necessarily between individual test functions.
Database Session Fixture (db_session):
Creates a function-scoped AsyncSession using the test_engine.
Uses sessionmaker with expire_on_commit=False (standard for async testing).
Yields the session to the test function.
Importantly: Calls await session.rollback() after the test yields. This ensures that any changes made within a single test function are rolled back, effectively isolating tests from each other database-wise within the same session run. This is a good pattern.
Test Client Fixture (test_client):
Provides a FastAPI TestClient.
Uses a settings fixture to override application settings (like DATABASE_URL, API keys) using app.dependency_overrides. This is the standard way to configure the app for testing.
Mock Fixtures: Provides pytest-mock (mocker) fixtures for external clients (eBay, Reverb, V&R). This indicates a pattern of mocking external dependencies at the boundary.
Sample Data Fixture (sample_product_data): Simple fixture providing basic product data.
Overall (conftest.py): This sets up a solid testing foundation using pytest conventions. It handles async database setup/teardown reasonably well (session-level clean slate + function-level rollback) and provides standard fixtures for the test client, settings overrides, and mocking.
2. test_db.py

Purpose: Appears to be a standalone script for basic database interaction testing and cleanup, rather than part of the main pytest suite run via the pytest command.
Functionality:
cleanup_test_data: Manually deletes test data (based on TEST-% SKU) in the correct dependency order. Uses app.database.get_session directly (not the db_session fixture from conftest.py).
test_create_product: Creates a Product, PlatformListing, and EbayListing, commits them, and then queries them back. Uses app.database.get_session.
run_tests / if __name__ == "__main__":: Runs the cleanup and create test sequentially.
Commentary: This looks like an early or auxiliary test script. It's useful for verifying basic model interactions but doesn't leverage the pytest framework, fixtures, or automatic rollback provided by conftest.py. Tests written for the main suite should use the fixtures (db_session, test_client). The cleanup logic might be useful if specific test scenarios require more complex cleanup than the standard rollback.
3. test_product_creation.py

Purpose: Similar to test_db.py, this seems like a standalone script focused on testing the ProductService.create_product method.
Functionality:
Uses app.database.async_session directly (again, not the db_session fixture).
Instantiates ProductService.
Creates a ProductCreate schema.
Calls product_service.create_product and then product_service.get_product.
Commentary: Useful for testing the service layer in isolation but, like test_db.py, doesn't integrate with the pytest framework and fixtures defined in conftest.py. Tests for services should ideally be written using pytest and the db_session fixture.
4. test_routes/test_inventory.py (Your most current example)

Purpose: Tests the FastAPI routes defined in app/routes/inventory.py using pytest.
Framework: Uses pytest (@pytest.mark.asyncio, @pytest.mark.parametrize, mocker fixture). This is the standard approach.
Fixtures: Relies on mocker (implicitly via pytest-mock) but doesn't explicitly use db_session or test_client fixtures from conftest.py in the function signatures. Instead, it seems to:
Use TestClient(app) directly within some tests (like test_add_product_success).
Directly call the route functions (e.g., await list_products(...), await product_detail(...)) in others, passing mocked arguments (mock_request, mock_session).
Mocking:
Extensively uses mocker and unittest.mock.MagicMock/AsyncMock to mock database session calls (mock_session.execute, scalar_one, scalars().all(), etc.) often using complex side_effect functions based on call order.
Mocks service layer calls (mocker.patch.object(ProductService, 'create_product', ...)).
Mocks utility functions (mocker.patch('app.routes.inventory.save_upload_file', ...)).
Mocks templates.TemplateResponse to capture the context passed to templates.
Mocks dependencies like get_settings sometimes.
Parameterization (@pytest.mark.parametrize): Used effectively in test_list_products_scenarios to test various filtering and pagination cases with different inputs and expected outputs.
Assertions: Checks status codes, response content (for API routes), template names and context dictionaries (for HTML routes), and mock call counts/arguments (assert_called_once, assert_awaited_once_with, etc.). Includes detailed checks on the context passed to templates.
Overall (test_inventory.py): This file demonstrates a comprehensive, albeit complex, approach to testing FastAPI routes using pytest and extensive mocking. The heavy reliance on mocking DB calls with side_effect based on call order can be effective but sometimes brittle if the order of DB operations within the route changes. Using the TestClient sometimes and directly calling route functions other times shows a slight inconsistency, but both are valid testing strategies. The parameterization is excellent.
5. test_routes/test_stock_manager.py (Likely Older/Integration?)

Purpose: Appears to test the StockManager's event handling logic (handle_stock_update).
Framework: Uses pytest.
Fixtures: Uses db_session from conftest.py to interact with the test database. Also uses the mock_..._client fixtures from conftest.py. Uses sample_product_data.
Style: This looks more like an integration test. It creates a real Product in the test database using the db_session fixture, then calls the StockManager method, and finally asserts that the mocked external clients were called correctly.
Commentary: This test combines real database interaction (via the fixture) with mocking of external service calls. This is a valid integration testing strategy. It tests that the StockManager correctly fetches data (implicitly, though not shown in this snippet) and calls the appropriate mocked external clients.
Key Takeaways for V&R Tests:

Use Pytest: Follow the pattern in test_inventory.py and test_stock_manager.py using @pytest.mark.asyncio.
Use Fixtures: Leverage conftest.py fixtures:
db_session: For tests involving database interactions (like testing VintageAndRareService's DB logic or VRExportService). The automatic rollback is very helpful.
mocker: For mocking dependencies.
Mocking Strategy:
For testing VintageAndRareService: Mock the VintageAndRareClient it uses and verify the correct methods are called with the right arguments. Use the real db_session fixture to test the database cleanup and import logic.
For testing VintageAndRareClient (non-Selenium methods like authenticate, download_inventory_dataframe, map_category): Mock requests.Session, pandas.read_csv (if needed), and CategoryMappingService. Test different response scenarios from requests.
For testing VRExportService: Use the real db_session fixture, populate it with test Product/PlatformCommon data, and assert the generated CSV content is correct.
For MediaHandler: Mock requests.get and file system operations (tempfile, shutil, os).
Selenium Testing (inspect_form.py): Acknowledge that pure unit testing is impractical. Focus on:
Live CLI Testing: Create a CLI command (or use the existing if __name__ == "__main__": in inspect_form.py carefully) to run the Selenium automation against the live V&R site (perhaps in test mode initially) for specific scenarios (create simple product, create product with all fields, etc.). This is effectively manual or semi-automated end-to-end testing.
(Optional) Integration Testing: Potentially create tests that do run Selenium via pytest, but perhaps against locally saved HTML files of the V&R form, or with heavy mocking of the webdriver object (less recommended). This would likely go in tests/integration/.
Consistency: Aim for the detailed assertion style seen in test_inventory.py where applicable (checking mock calls, arguments, return values). Use parameterization if testing multiple scenarios for a single function.
